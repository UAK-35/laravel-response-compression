|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| The README-versus-config reading, broken under itself
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| The break this file plants is a default moved in the config file and left alone in the README's
| copy of it — the disagreement an operator meets as a number that does not do what the README
| says it does, and one of the three silent defects this package shipped before the guard existed.
|
| The mutation is read twice on the same tree — once as this checkout ships it, where the reading
| has to answer with nothing, and once with the break in it, where it has to come back carrying
| the break's own marker rather than merely something. That is what tells a reading which went
| blind apart from one that answered nothing because nothing was wrong. The inversion is the other
| direction: the parse returns before it reads a line, so both sides of the comparison come back
| empty, and the guard's tests have to go red under it — a test that stays green while its reading
| cannot fire is the vacuous test this harness exists to refuse. Both directions read the guard's
| own call — the two halves of `ConfigDoc` — rather than a second implementation of it kept here.
